# downloaded-page

## I was Downloading one browser and i look at the page after the download starts and thinked "This is pretty good, may i can do something like that to improve"

- Only HTML, CSS & Javascript.
- The images are free or made by myself (icon).
- Its just something to challenge myself into something im laking, so trying to get better.
